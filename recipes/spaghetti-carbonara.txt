Spaghetti Carbonara

Ingredients:
- 8 ounces spaghetti
- 4 slices bacon, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

Instructions:
1. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside, leaving the bacon drippings in the pan.
3. In the same skillet, add the minced garlic to the bacon drippings and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.
4. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper.
5. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic and bacon drippings. Toss well to coat the spaghetti with the flavors.
6. Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg mixture, stirring continuously until the eggs are cooked and create a creamy sauce. Be careful not to cook the eggs too much, as they can become scrambled.
7. Stir in the cooked bacon and mix well.
8. Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara immediately, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
