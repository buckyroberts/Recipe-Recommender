Salmon Skillet

Ingredients:
4 salmon fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup white wine
Juice of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
Season the salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and dried rosemary on both sides.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon fillets, skin side down, and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side until browned and flaky. Remove the salmon from the skillet and set aside.
In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add Kalamata olives and cherry tomatoes to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes start to soften.
Pour in the white wine and lemon juice, bringing to a simmer. Let it cook for about 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
Stir in the chopped basil and parsley. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
Return the salmon fillets to the skillet and spoon the tomato-olive mixture over them. Sprinkle crumbled feta on top.
Cook for another 2-3 minutes to heat the salmon through.
Serve the Mediterranean Salmon with the flavorful sauce. Garnish with additional fresh herbs and a lemon wedge, if desired.
