Tuscan Chicken

Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup fresh spinach leaves
- 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- 1/2 cup artichoke hearts, quartered
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and dried oregano on both sides.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6-8 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Add cherry tomatoes, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes start to soften and spinach wilts.
5. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 2-3 minutes to reduce slightly.
6. Stir in the heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
7. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and spoon the sauce over them. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to heat the chicken through.
8. Serve the Tuscan Chicken with the creamy sauce on top. You can garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs, if desired.
