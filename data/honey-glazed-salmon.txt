Honey Glazed Salmon

Ingredients:
- 4 salmon fillets
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
2. Place salmon fillets in a dish and pour the marinade over them. Let them marinate for 20 minutes.
3. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon fillets (skin-side down if they have skin) and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the salmon easily flakes with a fork.
4. Serve hot with a drizzle of the remaining marinade from the pan.
